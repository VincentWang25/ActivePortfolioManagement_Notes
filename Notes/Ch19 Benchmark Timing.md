## 19.1 Introduction

1. Key Points:
   1. Successful benchmark timing is hard. The potential to add value is small, although **it rises with the number of independent bets per year.**
   2. Exceptional or unanticipated benchmark return is the key to the benchmark timing problem. **Forecasts of exceptional benchmark return lead to active beta positions.**
   3. We can generate active betas using futures or stocks with betas different from 1. There is a cost—measured in unavoidable residual risk and transactions costs—associated with relying on stocks for benchmark timing.
   4. Performance measurement schemes exist to evaluate benchmark timing skill.

## 19.2 Defining Benchmark Timing

1. If we believe that the benchmark will do better than usual, then beta is increased. If we believe the benchmark will do worse than usual, then beta should be decreased
2. we should think of benchmark timing as choosing the correct mixture of the benchmark portfolio and cash
3. and variations along that dimension should not cause any active residual bets in the portfolio; i.e., all the active risk will come from the active beta
4. $\mathrm{IR}_{\mathrm{BT}}=\mathrm{IC}_{\mathrm{BT}} \cdot \sqrt{\mathrm{BR}}$
   1. An independent benchmark timing forecast every quarter leads to a breadth of only 4. Then, to generate a benchmark timing information ratio of 0.2 requires an IC of 0.25, which is pretty high.
5. Stock selection strategies can diversify bets cross-sectionally across many stocks. Benchmark timing strategies can diversify only serially, through frequent bets per year. The fundamental law quantifies this. Significant benchmark timing value added can arise only with multiple bets per year. To keep this point clear, this chapter will monitor the forecast frequency: first once per year and later multiple times per year.
